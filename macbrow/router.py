"""Jev routing: utterance + live Mac state -> tool, arguments, confidence.

One request selects the tool (Choice over the tools currently available) and,
speculatively in the same request, every enum argument for every candidate
tool. Only the selected tool's answers are consumed. Free-text arguments need
the selected tool first, so they are filled in a second, tiny request that
asks Jev to *select* the right span of the utterance (no generation).
